        <div class="info-content">
          Each day of the tour will have the same goal: get to the best possible location to photograph incredible supercells over the great plains. We will start each day with a weather discussion led by our forecaster. Along the way, we will explain the weather patterns present and how we plan to intercept the storm at the perfect moment. Expect to learn more than you ever thought possible about weather and the conditions of the supercells. We will also conduct photography education sessions explaining in-the-field techniques and dedicated post-processing sessions.<br>
          All of our tours start and end in Denver, Colorado. We will provide transportation and lodging for the duration of the tour. Additional information will be sent upon registration.

          Expect to spend a lot of time in the car driving to the best location to photograph the supercells. After the chase has concluded for the day, we will find a nearby hotel for the evening. Because of the highly variable nature of storms, we are not able to accurately predict the exact route of our chase. We have relationships at dozens of hotels along the plains and will find a single occupancy room for you every night.

          Above all else, we value safety. Our specialty is getting clients to a position where the storm is most photogenic. Most of the time, that approach would keep us at a greater distance from the storm compared to other chase companies that may drive much closer to a potential tornado.
