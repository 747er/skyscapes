This is a wonderful high energy adventure with Bryan and Steve, that takes you through multiple states and many miles as you follow the storms.
Steve, an excellent forecaster, places you in the perfect position to capture the storm as it develops.
Bryan is a renown photographer, who determines the correct alignment between your camera and the storm so you get the best photograph possible. He is beyond helpful.
Together they are a team like no other.
Get ready for an adventure of a lifetime.

Combine Bryan, Steve, and massive storms and you get high energy and excitement. Hair standing up on your arms and the back of your neck kind of excitement! Go along on the journey and laugh, learn, and stand in amazement of nature. I was new to the whole storm chase thing until I went out with these guys and now I’m hooked!! Word of caution here...it is very addicting!

This was my first photography workshop experience and what a incredible way to start! Steve and Bryan took us to some amazing locations for storms and landscapes, they were genuine in their encouragement and generous in sharing their knowledge and experiences. No question was too simple or challenging and they helped all participants from different backgrounds with varying degrees of knowledge, skill and equipment learn and grow as photographers. Their attention was 100% focused on participants in the field (and they watch our backs as the storms loomed close). I can highly recommend any workshop and can't wait to go back!
